### Trello Clone 
This is an Agile project created as part of Parsity’s software engineering program. As a software engineering team, we took on the roles of a Frontend Lead, Backend Lead, Designer and Product Owner. We were asked to create a full-stack task management app that functions like Trello. The project was built with React on the front end, Node and Express on the backend, MongoDB for database management, and Redux Toolkit for global state management. The project features different boards, cards lists that users can customize to help their team stay organized.
